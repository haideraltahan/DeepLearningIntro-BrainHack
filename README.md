# Intro to Deep Learning
##### Jordan DeKraker & Haider Al-Tahan

This is the practical component of this tutorial will focus on hands-on experience with TensorFlow. Topics will include:

1.   Introduction to TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. 
2.   Train and evaluate  of dense and convolutional neural networks for real problems.
3.   An open session for exploring and adapting existing NNs or for helping attendees build their own networks.

You can use [Google Colaboratory]('http://colab.research.google.com') notebook file which is a [Jupyter notebook]('https://jupyter.org/') with free limited access to a GPU. Jupyter notebooks allows python programs to run directly in the browser which can be great way to learn and use TensorFlow.

# Instructions

All material of the practical presentation is available in the jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`). You can run jupyter notebook locally or using google colab.
* To run it on google colab,
    1. go to http://colab.research.google.com and click on `File` located in top-left corner > `Open notebook...`.
    2. Click on `Github` in the header of the opened view.
    3. 

# Resources

1. Course on [Convolutional Neural Networks]('http://cs231n.stanford.edu/') from Stanford.
